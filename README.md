# 3D models of COVID-19 related proteins guided by predicted inter-residue distances
For the 10 COVID-19 related proteins released by CASP Commons
<hr>

## Our structure prediction method
* Our overall method is demonstrated [here](./Full-Pipeline.md)
* Full details are yet to be published

## Our method for the COVID-19 protein targets
| Protein (target)  | L  | Aln. size (e-value = 0.001) | Aln. size (e-value = 0.1) | # of models |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1901 | 638 | 249  | -  | 25 |
| C1902 | 500  | 499  | - | 17 |
| C1903 | 290  | 357  | -  | 150 |
| C1904 | 686  | 166  |  - | 12 |
| C1905 | 275  | 26  |  - | 200 |
| C1906 | 222  | 160  | -  | 100 |
| C1907 | 61  |  12 |  - |350 |
| C1908 | 121  |  12 | 1919  | 420 |
